human_number_converter
======================

This is a js function which accepts a human generated string as input (like "three hundred thirty five") and gives back a number.

I couldn't find it on the web, so I made it. I haven't broken it yet, but more test cases would be good, and please if you find a bug issue a pull request.

##notes:
 
 - Doesn't support number recognition over the quintillions place (already more than javascript's max int size)
 - Doesn't support fractions or decimal notations.
